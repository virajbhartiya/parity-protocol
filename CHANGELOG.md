## Summary

This changelog documents the evolution of the Parity Protocol across four repositories from January 2025 through July 2025, with the hackathon period beginning after May 15th, 2025.

### Pre-Hackathon Development (≤ 15 May 2025)

The pre-hackathon period focused on establishing robust foundational infrastructure:

**Core Infrastructure & Architecture:**

- Standardized CLI command structures and migrated from YAML to environment-based configuration
- Consolidated Docker functionality and implemented comprehensive task validation systems
- Transitioned from WebSockets to webhooks for improved reliability
- Migrated from gorilla/mux to Gin web framework across services
- Split monolithic packages into modular submodules for better maintainability

**Security & Authentication:**

- Implemented keystore-based authentication and wallet management
- Added nonce verification and image digest verification for Docker tasks
- Migrated from go-parity-wallet to go-wallet-sdk for enhanced security
- Implemented stake-based validation and device-based staking systems

**Development & Testing:**

- Established comprehensive testing suites with mock implementations
- Added CI/CD workflows for linting, testing, and dependency management
- Implemented precommit hooks and code quality measures
- Created extensive documentation and setup instructions

### During Hackathon (> 15 May 2025)
